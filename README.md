# Solar_Tracker_System_project
A solar tracker system that adjusts the angle of a solar panel to maximize sunlight exposure using light sensors and an Arduino. The system detects the sunâ€™s position through two LDR sensors and controls a servo motor to optimize the solar panel's alignment.

Features
1. Automatic Sun Tracking: Adjusts solar panel angle based on light intensity difference between two sensors.
2. Servo Motor Control: Panel angle is adjusted in response to the detected light.
3. Simulation: Fully simulated in Tinkercad for visualization and testing.
